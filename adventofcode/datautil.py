    the input data for the specified problem. If there already exists a data
    file for the problem, let user know and don't request anything.
    If there is no prior datafile for the problem, asyncronously send the 
    GET request with together with the user cookie called `session.token`.
    This token is required since each datafile is different from user
    to user; also to access a puzzle input one has to be logged in on the
    website. If there is no user cookie, or no file `session.token`, then
    the function raises a `FileNotFoundError` letting the user know that 
    they have to set up the cookie. 

    There are ofcourse two parts for each problem, but they share the same
    input data, so if the user is missing the data for both solution
    year=2021,day=02,part=1 and part=2, only one request will be made for
    the year and day.

    ----------
    year : str
