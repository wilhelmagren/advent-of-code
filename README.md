# Advent of Code 2021
Merry christmas! :christmas_tree: :santa:

To get solutions and approximate execution times for implementations, please execute the ```run.py``` script in the following manner:
```
usage: AoC2021 pipieline [days] [parts] [options]
optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-d [DAYS [DAYS ...]], --days [DAYS [DAYS ...]]
                      set what days to solve
-p [PARTS [PARTS ...]], --parts [PARTS [PARTS ...]]
                      set which parts of a day to solve
-v, --verbose         set logging in verbose mode


$ python3 run.py -d 1 -p 1 2 -v
Solving day=01 part=1
---------------------
answer: 1393
time: 84845700 ns

Solving day=01 part=2
---------------------
answer: 1359
time: 45983800 ns     
```
